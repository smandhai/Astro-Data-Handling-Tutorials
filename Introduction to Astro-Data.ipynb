    "Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are among the highest energy events that arise within the Universe. They can outshine galaxies and can be seen at extremely high redshift. There are two primary classes of GRBs, short and long. These are characterised by the time taken for 5\\% - 95\\% of the flux to be detected (T90). Short GRBs have T90s typically <2 s, whilst for Long GRBs, the T90s are >2 s.  \n",

    "- Download some GRB light curves\n",

    "- Download and visualise location skymaps corresponding to the GRB\n",

    "- Circle regions of interest\n",
